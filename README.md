Search and analysis of potentially habitable exoplanets

Analysis of potentially habitable exoplanets using the following publicly available dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/franoisgeorgesjulien/nasa-exoplanet-archive-planetary-systems

The criteria used to determine potential habitability:
* Planet radius - 0.5 – 2.0 Earth radii. This suggests small, rock-based planets which are similar to Earth.
* Stellar flux - 0.35 – 1.5 Earth units. This means that the planet is in the habitable zone of its star, i.e., it receives enough light and heat to support life and for water to be in liquid form.
* Temperature of host star - 4,000–7,000 K. This temperature range filters stars of a similar temperature to the Sun.
